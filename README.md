Python challenge for Technical interview.

## The Problem

A company has a hierarchical employee structure with each employee having a line manager. The structure looks like this:
```
        Joe
        |
        |
   -- Harry ---
  |           |
Chang       Mary
              |
            Alfonse
```

Write a C# console application that takes an employee name as an argument and returns all employees that report to them all the way down the hierarchy. (Note not only their direct sub-ordinates but all sub-ordinates right up to the leaf level)
As an example, the function would return Chang, Mary and Alfonse for an argument of Harry.

This problem can also be attempted as a Python Jupyter Notebook instead of a C# application.

### Running

Run the Python Jupyter Notebook, ensure all jupyter dependecies are installed.
